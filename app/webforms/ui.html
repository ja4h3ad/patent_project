<h2>Transcript Parser</h2>
<h3 class="form-text">Patent similarity detection</h3>

<h3>This project implementes the following use cases:</h3>
<p>
Personas:

•	Potential Inventor
•	Patent Search Service (PSS, “The System”) returning the potential matches and a possible success-based rating

1.	Front-end UI parser:
Given:  Potential Inventor enters a string of words based on their invention idea
When:  The user presses “submit”
Then:  The patent-search service will accept the string and parse the string using SOTA NLP concepts.

2.	Web-Scraper:

Given:  The database of inventions for patents.google.com needs to be added to the server-side application
When:  PSS scrapes the google database - this is a handcrafted process due to the Google trickeration
Then:  Essential elements of information (patent ID, filing date, etc.) will be added to the PSS database

3.	NLP Pipeline

Given:  The potential Inventor has entered a string via the form field
When:  The user presses submit
Then:  The PSS will remove unwanted elements from the string and store the cleaned/tokenized data as a database entry

4.	Potential Inventor feedback loop

Given:  The Potential Inventor has entered a search string and pressed submit:
When:  the string has been pre-processed for NLP
Then:  The UI will return the tokenized string as well as the collected search string and search ID  (Depending on my
  investigation into the google patent data, I might limit some of the standard pre-processing).

5.	 Similarity Detection and Rating

Given:  Potential Inventor has entered search string and the search string has been parsed by the PSS
When:  The PSS detects a similarity to the Potential Inventor parsed request string
Then:  The PSS will provide feedback to the Potential Inventor indicating that (a) a similarity exists to other
  patents and (b) a measurement of the similarity on a scale of 1 to 3.  This numerical rating will operate
  in this fashion:  1 = high levels of similarity to other patents; 2 = neutral similarity rating; 3 = no similarity
